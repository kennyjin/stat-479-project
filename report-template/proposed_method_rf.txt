Random forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make the final prediction. Comparing to using a single decision tree, the method of random forest is usually more robust to overfitting, thus this model will perform better than decision tree on the test set. Therefore, we decided that this model will also be included in our experiment.

Random Forest models can be useful for feature selection, thus when using random forest for prediction, it might be unnecessary to adopt dimensionality reduction techniques before feeding the data into the model. However, we still wanted to compare the prediction performance of random forest between differently manipulated datasets. Thus, we will still use the 2 dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA, Autoencoder) and compare the prediction result with that of the original dataset.
