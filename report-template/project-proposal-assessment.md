# Project Proposal Assessment

The proposal will be graded based on completeness of each of the 5 sections (Introduction, Motivation, Evaluation, Resources, and Contributions) and *not* be based on language, stule, and how "exciting" or "interesting" the project is. For each section, you can receive a maximum of 10 points, totalling 50 pts for the proposal overall.

Also, it is important to make sure that you acknowledge previous work and use citations properly when referring to other people's work. Even minor forms of plagiarism (e.g., copying sentences from other texts) will result in a subtraction of at least 10 pts each per incidence. And university guidelines dictate that severe incidents need to be reported. If you are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it, please see the helpful guides at https://conduct.students.wisc.edu/plagiarism/
