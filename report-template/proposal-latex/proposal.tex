\begin{itemize}

	\item This template is based on the CVPR conference template\footnote{\url{http://statcourse2018.thecvf.com/submission/main_conference/author_guidelines}}.
	
	\item The information in this template is very minimal, and this file should serve you as a framework for writing your proposal. You may prefer to use a more collaboration-friendly tool while drafting the report with your class mates before you prepare the final report for submission. Remember that you should \textbf{submit both the report and code} you used for this project via Canvas. Also, \textbf{only one member per team} needs to submit the project material.
	
	\item The project proposal is a 2-4 page document excluding references\footnote{This means, references should of course be included but do not count towards the page limit}.
	
	\item You are encouraged (not required) to use 1-2 figures to illustrate technical concepts.
	
	\item The proposal must be formatted and submitted as a PDF document on Canvas (the submission deadline will be later announced via the schedule \& email).
	
	\item Please
	check out the text in these sections for further information.
	
\end{itemize}




\section{Introduction}


In this section, describe what you are planning to do. Also, briefly describe related work.


When discussing related work, do not forget to include appropriate references.  This is an example of a citation \cite{mirjalili2018gender}. To format the citations properly, put the
corresponding references into the bibliography.bib file. You can obtain
BibTeX-formatted references for the "bib" file from Google Scholar 
(\url{https://scholar.google.com}), for example, by clicking on the 
double-quote character under a citation and then selecting \mbox{"BibTeX"} as
shown in Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-1col} and 
Figure \ref{fig:google-scholar-2col}.

\section{Motivation}

Describe why your project is interesting. E.g., you can describe why your project could have a broader societal impact. Or, you may describe the motivation from a personal learning perspective.

\section{Evaluation}

What would the successful outcome of your project look like? In other words, under which circumstances would you consider your project to be “successful?”

How do you measure success, specific to this project, from a technical standpoint?

\section{Resources}

What resources are you going to use (datasets, computer hardware, computational tools, etc.)?

\section{Contributions}

You are expected to share the workload evenly, and every group member is expected to participate in both the experiments and writing. (As a group, you only need to submit one proposal and one report, though. So you need to work together and coordinate your efforts.)

Clearly indicate what computational and writing task each member of your group will be participating in.
