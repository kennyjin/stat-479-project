After the training of each neural network, we observed that for LeNet-5, the model will converge under all of the 3 learning rates (0.0001, 0.0005 and 0.001). However, when learning rate is 0.0005, the test set prediction accuracy is 46.58\%, the highest of all these 3 learning rates. For ResNet-34, the model seems to be converging under both learning rates (0.001, 0.005), although the learning rate 0.001 will give a better test set prediction accuracy of 59.87\%. The training of ResNet-34 (10 epochs) clearly takes more time than that of LeNet-5 (50 epochs).
