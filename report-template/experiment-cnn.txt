We selected LeNet-5 and ResNet-34 for the prediction task. The implementation of these 2 models is adapted from Professor Raschka's code\footnote{https://github.com/rasbt/deeplearning-models} for deep learning models. For both LeNet-5 and ResNet-34, we set the batch size equal to 128. The number of epochs for training are set differently for these 2 CNNs. We set NUM\_EPOCHS = 50 for LeNet-5, but set it to 10 for ResNet-34, since the structure of ResNet-34 is more complicated and it needs more training time for each epoch. We also set the RANDOM\_SEED = 123 for the training of each CNN.

For deep neural networks, the learning rate settings are important. The cost function of a CNN could fail to converge under an improper setting of learning rate. To make sure each model converges, we tried different learning rates for each model. For LeNet-5, we set the learning rates to be 0.0001, 0.0005 and 0.001. For ResNet-34, we set the learning rates to be 0.001, 0.005. By checking the plots of the cost vs number of epochs, we are able to see if the training of CNN converges.
